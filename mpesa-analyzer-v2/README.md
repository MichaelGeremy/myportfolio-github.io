A premium web application that transforms M-Pesa statements into actionable business insights.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Fixed Critical Issues
- **Health Score Redesign**: Multi-dimensional scoring (Profitability, Efficiency, Cash Flow, Growth) with clear improvement paths instead of demotivating single score

- **Date Filtering**: 30/90 day views with comparison to previous periods
